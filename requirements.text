DESCRIPTION

>> The model uses tesseract-ocr library to extract all the text from the image whose address has to be passed earlier in the code.

>> Next, out of that extracted data, user is asked if he/she want to ask anything or have a doubt from the extracted data. This is done via voice output from the system as well as text

>> After the user enters his/her query, the processing starts at the backend. That specific keyword is searched online and the first link appearing is grabbed using web scrapping. 

>> In that link, again all the text is collected and made in the form an article. 

>> Now comes the part of NLP. Here, from that extracted paragraphs, all extra brackets and extra spaces are removed. Along with this, extra numbers and special characters are also removed.

>> Next, weighted frequency of occurrence is found out. to find the weighted frequency, simply divide the number of occurances of all the words by the frequency of the most occurring word.

>> Lastly, calculate the sentence scores and then summarise the data. 

>> Now just print this on the output console.
